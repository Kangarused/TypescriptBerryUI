This project is based on the awesome [Berry UI free template](https://berrydashboard.io/free/) built with React and Material UI. I have manually converted the entire project to typescript and also taken the time to reverse engineer the unfinished theming that was present in the free template. 

Currently the Berry UI free template is more of a demo application, the intention of this project is to turn it back into a template that dev teams can run with immediately.

If you find this template helpful at all please :star: it and help spread the word!


## Goals
- Provide a free typescript Berry template
- Streamline the template
- Improve the code base
- Reduce bundle size

## Out of scope
This is not a 1:1 recreation of the free template, this is a heavily striped back version that provides a launchpad for dev teams who want to use the Berry UI template for their bespoke application. As such, the aim will be to only provide components that are necessary.
- Full 1:1 recreation of free template
- Demo pages
- Component library
